# Professions+

A little extra on top of [Professions](https://github.com/strongpauly/professions)

We also include job categories generated by chatGPT and a link between jobs and their category.

Here is the [chatGPT conversation](https://chat.openai.com/share/b013267d-d847-44cf-8437-269ebd32a118)

This is just a starting point to seed some initial rows into your database. Make sure you include a module or method to allow users to add new jobs.
